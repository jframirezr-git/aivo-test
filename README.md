### Before start

We recommend use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work in this project, also there's a few prerequisites such as:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

## Tech Stack

- Core: [Angular](https://angular.io/)

## Architecture

The project keep and follow the most used patterns within Angular projects, however, it has custom handlers and other patterns to maintain and handle the flow data trough the entire application.

> Always try to follow the best practices of the pattern we're using here.
